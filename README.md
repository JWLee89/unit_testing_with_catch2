# Catch2 Unit Test

There are no required dependencies to get started. 
Everything required to run unit test is contained within
`catch.hpp`. 

To build `catch2` on your local device, refer to the instructions
in the following link.

## Getting Started. 


## Do Not

- Delete `catch.hpp` or `catch_test_macros.hpp`. 
By removing these two files, the unit test will not work.
